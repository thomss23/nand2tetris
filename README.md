# nand2tetris

## Course structure
This is a course I've been doing to learn more about computer architecture. This was achieved by asking the students to build a computer from scratch, as the title suggests, starting from a given nand gate to writing a game in Jack (the language created in this course).

### Course Projects 
 * Projects 1-5 : Develop a complete architecture that follows the von Neumann model (Harvard variation). Each chip was implemented using a custom HDL language provided by the course instructors. In project 4 the task was to write 2 programs in assembly code (hack language) to get more used to low-level programming.

 * Project 6 - Develop an assembler in Java (my language of choice) for the hack computer.

 * Projects 7,8 - Develop a VM which translates a given vm code (an intermediary language like bytecode for java) to assembly code. 

 * Project 9 - Develop a game in Jack. I have created a simple game that lets you control a rectangle that shoots bullets into squares. I decided I wanted to do something with a graphical interface because it was more fun to me. The project's source code and a youtube video for a demo can be found [here](https://github.com/thomss23/BlockShooter).

 * Projects 10 - Develop a syntax analyzer for the Jack language.

 * Projects 11 - Extend the syntaz analyzer into a full jack compiler.
